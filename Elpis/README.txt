Elpis is also free (as in "free speech" and "free cookies") software. If you paid for this software, you have been scammed and should demand your money back. Also, please contact elpis@adamhaile.net if this ever happens. 

Elpis (as well as it's libraries) and it's creator are not affiliated  with or endorsed by Pandora Media, Inc.
As such, Elpis depends on an independent implementation of their private API, meaning that changes made by Pandora can, and may, break compatability with Elpis at any time, without warning. 
It is the intention of it's creator that Elpis be kept up to date and compatible with the Pandora service and any needed changes be made quickly, but NO GURANTEE is provided to this effect.  
If you find that Elpis no longer functions with the Pandora service please either run the application again and let it check for updates (occurs on every application start) or visit http://elpis.adamhaile.net (or https://github.com/adammhaile/Elpis).

IMPORTANT NOTE FROM THE CREATOR:
Elpis was created out of a great love for the service provided by Pandora Media, Inc. 
But Pandora is still a business and if we all want to continue to enjoy the great product, through Elpis or otherwise, it is strongly suggested that you support them in any way possible. 
Purchasing a Pandora One subscription is one of the best ways and allows you to stream the music in even better quality (192kbps MP3 - Change it in Elpis settings after subscribing). 
If you do not subscribe, please at least visit pandora.com and click on the ad links or click on any of the Title, Artist or Album text from within Elpis to be taken to the pandora.com info page for it and buy the song or the album. Every time you do this, Pandora gets a cut of the sale.
