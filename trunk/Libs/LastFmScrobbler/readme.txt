LastFMScrobbler is not my own work, but the work of Daniel Larsen.

As opposed to simply using a precompiled DLL, Elpis uses its own version of LastFMScrobbler for the following reasons:

- Elpis uses .NET Client Profile and LastFMScrobbler had to be reworked to not use some full profile methods.
- Some custom changes were made for the sake of better integration into Elpis. All changes should be API compatible with the official version.
- Some methods were added to expand the abilities of the library. (Code has been submitted to the original developer).
